Made in a week for the Brackeys Game Jam 2025.2

> Can you win all 7 matches? Play this trick-taking game where you must carefully select whether you bid safely or go big and rack in the score. To help you there are extra Triumphs that give you powers - will you use them to save a bad hand or capitalise on an already good one?
